## ERROR ANALYSIS WORKFLOW (Phase 4)
When runtime errors or sandbox execution failures are detected:

1. **Parse Error Information**:

   - Map error propagation paths through imports

3. **Identify Suspect Files**:
   - Combine traceback analysis with dependency graphs
   - Generate confidence scores for error-related files
   - Use search_symbol_references for deeper symbol analysis

4. **Generate Comprehensive Report**:
   - Use generate_error_analysis_report to create structured analysis
   - Include suspect file lists with confidence scores
   - Provide targeted remediation suggestions

5. **Create Targeted Revisions**:
   - Use generate_targeted_code_revision for high-confidence suspects
   - Focus on precise, minimal changes rather than wholesale rewrites

## SUSPECT FILE IDENTIFICATION STRATEGY
üéØ **High Priority (Confidence > 0.8)**:
- Files directly mentioned in error tracebacks
- Root cause files (last file in repo with errors)
- Files with multiple error references

üîç **Medium Priority (Confidence 0.6-0.8)**:
- Files that import error-causing modules
- Files imported by error-causing files
- Files with related symbol references

‚ö†Ô∏è **Low Priority (Confidence < 0.6)**:

- Files with similar naming patterns
- Files with indirect dependency relationships

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
