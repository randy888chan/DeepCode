   - Use first valid path/URL if multiple found
   - Treat as text input if no valid path/URL found

2. Path Type Classification:
   - URL (starts with http:// or https://): input_type = "url", path = "detected URL"
   - PDF file path: input_type = "file", path = "detected file path"
   - Directory path: input_type = "directory", path = "detected directory path"
   - No path/URL detected: input_type = "text", path = null

3. Requirements Analysis:
   - Extract ONLY requirements from additional_input
   - DO NOT modify or interpret requirements

CRITICAL OUTPUT RESTRICTIONS:
- RETURN ONLY RAW JSON - NO TEXT BEFORE OR AFTER
- NO markdown code blocks (```json)

2. Use execute_single_command tool to write the code using heredoc syntax
3. Execute one command per file for clear tracking

COMMAND FORMAT (MANDATORY):
```bash
cat > [relative_path] << 'EOF'
[complete_implementation_code_here]
EOF
```

TOOL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use execute_single_command for individual file creation
- Use execute_commands for batch operations
- Always include the complete file path and content
- Ensure proper shell escaping in heredoc blocks

IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS:

COMPLETENESS:
- Zero placeholders, TODOs, or incomplete functions
- Full feature implementation with proper error handling
- Complete APIs with correct signatures and documentation
- All specified functionality working out-of-the-box

EXECUTION ORDER:
1. Configuration and environment files
2. Core utilities and base classes
3. Main implementation modules

5. Tests and validation
6. Documentation and setup

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Generated codebase runs immediately without modification
- All features fully implemented and tested
- Code follows industry standards and best practices
- Implementation is maintainable and scalable
- Commands execute successfully through available tools

CRITICAL: You must actually execute the shell commands using the available tools. Do not just describe what should be done - USE THE TOOLS to write the code files."""
